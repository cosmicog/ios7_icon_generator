# Why using iOS icons in Android?
Once upon a time, I was an ios user for a short time, and only thing I liked about was, the design. I simply could not send a single small file to an android using bluetooth. It wasn't the only thing that I can't do, but let's move on. In this very time, There are tons of stuff that Android can do, but iOS can't. Android even allows you to design your own phone!

I tried lots of different theming options, making my own options, using ios themes, but none was letting me have the premium look that current iOS has but Android doesn't. And I decided to make my own design. You can decide on your own, but none of the screenshots below are looking any better than the top one according to al people I've asked their opinion. 

I or no one can easily beat the designers of the biggest design company, Apple Inc. I simply can't. So I decided to use ios icons. Then there was this feeling... My phone looks very fake. But still better than most of the other icon themes. And I was getting bored of the classic look. I tried to figure out what about it is so special, and saw some stuff like the mask, glades etc. I saw how they changed icon mask from ios6 to ios7 and now it's stil the standard in ios13. 


I maybe can't beat the apple designers, but I can improve theirs! To get rid of the fake look, I changed some, and created some of the icons myself, you can track my progress in `in` folder. Here is the last result I have / how my phone looks like:

And I'll continue improving it by time. First plan is, when having free time, I'll try to find a way to generate icons like this concept design: [ios-13-dark-mode-concept](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9158844/65207861-da5fac80-da9b-11e9-8bf0-134be6723c60.jpg)

Here are some combinations I've tried them in different times, I kept a screenshot of each before changing them:

## Usage :penguin:
#### (Ubuntu)

 If you put perfect square icons that are bigger than `192x192` in `in` folder:

 You can convert them all by this command (Note: by default, it generates with all masks in this repository):
     
     $ ./makeAll.sh in
 
 Below like outputs will be in `*_in` directories:
